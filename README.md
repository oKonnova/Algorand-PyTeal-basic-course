# Algorand-PyTeal-basic-course
The course is dedicated to studying technologies for creating decentralized applications on the Algorand blockchain. In particular, the PyTeal language for creating Algorand smart contracts is considered.
This course introduces students to the fundamentals of blockchain technology and the principles of developing decentralized applications (dApps) on the Algorand platform. You will learn how smart contracts work, how to create them using TEAL and PyTeal, and gain hands-on experience in deploying and testing contracts in the Algorand environment. Special attention is given to Web3 security, asset tokenization (ASA), using the Pera Wallet, and building real-world projects.

### Course Objectives:
- Develop an understanding of the fundamentals of blockchain technology and the principles behind decentralized applications (dApps).  
- Master the principles and practical aspects of smart contract development on the blockchain.  
- Learn to use TEAL and PyTeal to write Algorand smart contracts (ACS1) and deploy them on the Algorand blockchain.  
- Gain insight into smart contract security and critical processes in blockchain/Web3 development.
- Gain practical experience with PyTeal, transactions, ASA, and wallets.
